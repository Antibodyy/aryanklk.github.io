I'm a mechanical engineering graduate student at UC Berkeley with hands-on experience in FEA, thermal analysis, and 3D CAD. My passion lies in the design and fabrication of electro-mechanical systems for semiconductor manufacturing.

## Current Work

I'm currently pursuing my M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley (GPA: 3.8/4.0), where I'm working on cutting-edge projects in manufacturing systems, PCB design, and automation. My recent work includes:

- **HeliCAL Manufacturing System**: Executing structural and opto-mechanical design for a large-format novel lithography system, leading development of high-precision metrology setups with sub-micron accuracy
- **EEG Signal Acquisition PCB**: Designed and debugged a custom PCB in KiCAD for high-sensitivity analog signal acquisition
- **Automation & Robotics**: Building autonomous systems with SLAM and CNN-based navigation, plus MPC-based control for real-time stabilization

## Background

I completed my B.E. in Mechanical Engineering (Hons.) from BITS Pilani with a 9.32/10.0 GPA. During my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable industry experience through internships at:

- **UBS** (Product Control, Capital Markets)
- **Speed Engineering Solutions** (FEA validation and pressure vessel integrity analysis)
- **Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research** (Nuclear reactor cooling systems research)

## Technical Expertise

My technical skillset spans across:
- **CAD & Design**: SolidWorks, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, KiCAD
- **Engineering Analysis**: ANSYS Workbench (Structural, Thermal, Harmonic, FEA), MATLAB, SIMULINK
- **Programming**: Python, C++, ROS2
- **Prototyping**: 3D Printing, Soldering, PCB Design, Design Validation
