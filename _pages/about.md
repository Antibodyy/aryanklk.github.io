I am a mechanical engineering graduate student at UC Berkeley with hands-on experience in FEA, thermal analysis, and 3D CAD. My passion lies in the design and fabrication of electro-mechanical systems for semiconductor manufacturing.

## Current Work

I'm currently pursuing my M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley (GPA: 3.8/4.0). My current projects and coursework include:

- **HeliCAL Manufacturing System**: Large-format novel lithography-based, 3D printing technology
- **Design of Microprocessor-based Mechanical Systems**: Course project involving embedded systems and mechatronics integration
- **Next Generation Data Centers and Energy Management**: Course project focused on thermal management and energy efficiency optimization
- **Deep Tech Innovation**: Startup consulting work on market research and product-market fit analysis for emerging technologies

## Background

During my undergraduate studies at BITS Pilani (B.E. Mechanical Engineering, GPA: 9.32/10.0), I gained industry experience through internships:

**Product Control Intern, UBS Investment Bank**
*Mumbai, India (Jan 2025 - May 2025)*

**Mechanical Engineering Intern, Speed Engineering Solutions**
*Pune, India (May 2024 - Jul 2024)*

**Research Intern, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research**
*Kalpakkam, India (May 2023 - Jul 2023)*

**Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, BITS Pilani**
*Pilani, India (Jan 2024 - May 2024)*

## Technical Expertise

My technical skillset spans across:
- **CAD & Design**: SolidWorks, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, KiCAD
- **Engineering Analysis**: ANSYS Workbench (Structural, Thermal, Harmonic, FEA), MATLAB, SIMULINK
- **Programming**: Python, C++, ROS2
- **Prototyping**: 3D Printing, Soldering, PCB Design, Design Validation
