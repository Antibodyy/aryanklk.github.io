I am a mechanical engineering graduate student at UC Berkeley with hands-on experience in FEA, thermal analysis, and 3D CAD. My passion lies in the design and fabrication of electro-mechanical systems for semiconductor manufacturing.

I'm currently pursuing my M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, working on projects ranging from large-format 3D printing systems to thermal management in data centers. My background includes internships in product control, mechanical engineering, and nuclear research, complemented by teaching experience at BITS Pilani.

This site showcases my projects, coursework, and professional experience. Check out my [CV](/cv/) for more details.
