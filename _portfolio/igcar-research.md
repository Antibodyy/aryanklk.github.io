Identified mechanical degradation mechanisms in nuclear reactor cooling systems with potential cost impact exceeding Rs. 4,000,000/day.

## My Contributions

* **Studied mechanical degradation of nuclear reactor cooling pipes** caused by sodium insulation interaction, investigating failure mechanisms critical to reactor safety and operational continuity

* **Collaborated cross-functionally across 6 departments** to conduct chemical and morphological evaluations under varying temperature and environmental conditions, coordinating complex multi-disciplinary research

* **Delivered technical presentation on bulk and surface property changes** highlighting degradation mechanisms and potential operational losses exceeding Rs. 4,000,000/day, informing maintenance and design decisions

## About This Role

This research internship at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), India's premier nuclear research facility, focused on understanding material degradation in fast breeder reactor cooling systems. The work involved multi-disciplinary collaboration to assess critical infrastructure integrity.

## Skills Applied

* Materials characterization and degradation analysis
* Cross-functional collaboration in research environment
* Chemical and morphological evaluation techniques
* Nuclear engineering systems understanding
* Technical presentation and communication
* High-stakes failure analysis

**Timeline**: May 2023 - July 2023
