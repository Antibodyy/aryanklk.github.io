Improved pressure vessel safety margin by 89% through comprehensive FEA validation and design optimization.

## My Contributions

* **Performed FEA validation in ANSYS Workbench** to assess pressure vessel integrity under complex thermal and mechanical loads, identifying potential failure modes before manufacturing

* **Executed comprehensive structural, thermal, and harmonic analyses** to identify high-risk failure modes and critical design weaknesses in pressure vessel components

* **Implemented design changes that improved safety margin by 89%** through systematic optimization based on FEA results, and prepared technical documentation and reports for client delivery

## About This Role

This mechanical engineering internship at Speed Engineering Solutions focused on finite element analysis and structural validation of pressure vessels. The work involved applying advanced simulation techniques to ensure component safety and reliability under demanding operating conditions.

## Skills Applied

* **FEA Software**: ANSYS Workbench (Structural, Thermal, Harmonic Analysis)
* **Engineering Analysis**: Stress analysis, thermal analysis, failure mode identification
* **Design Optimization**: Safety margin improvement, design iteration
* **Technical Communication**: Report preparation, documentation

**Timeline**: May 2024 - July 2024
