## My Contributions

### Daily P&L Production & Validation
* **Produced and validated T+1 P&L reports** for four major trading books (Global TERM Index, Inventory Management EM Index, Synthetic PB Index, and Synthetic Futures) with daily run rates ranging from $50k to $300k

* **Performed Risk Sensitivity-based P&L estimation** comparing risk exposures against market movements to forecast preliminary T+1 figures, providing early indicators for trading desk review

* **Executed critical preprocessing activities** including RFA timing adjustments, FX close regional timing corrections, and dividend AVI calculations to ensure accurate P&L consolidation from multiple source systems (Ledger, Geronimo, Sabre, COLT, Global One)

### Variance Investigation & Resolution

* **Resolved breaks through ledger adjustments and system corrections**, coordinating with trading desk, middle office, and IT teams to validate figures and maintain data integrity across reporting systems (One View, SAP BO, RAM, Equity Consol, SCP, Hydra)

* **Performed daily Mark-to-Market (MTM) P&L reconciliation**, validating end-of-day rates, valuations, funding charges, and internal fees to ensure accurate reflection of trading book positions

### Process Improvement & Documentation
* **Standardized recurring manual P&L adjustments** including RFA timing corrections, FX close timing adjustments, index marking, and dividend rake-offs, reducing processing time and improving consistency

* **Documented P&L delivery workflows and control checks**, creating comprehensive process documentation that improved team knowledge transfer and onboarding efficiency
