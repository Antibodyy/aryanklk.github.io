Developed computational models and optimization algorithms for advanced manufacturing processes including robotic 3D printing, laser heating, and multi-physics simulations.

## My Contributions

* **Implemented optimization algorithms** including Newton's Method with PyTorch automatic differentiation and Genetic Algorithms with parent selection and crossover breeding, comparing convergence behavior and demonstrating rapid minimization of complex manufacturing cost functions with sub-micron tolerance

* **Modeled robotic 3D printing systems** by developing forward kinematics for multi-link robot arms, computing droplet dynamics under electromagnetic forces and drag, and implementing Forward Euler time-stepping to simulate material deposition with electrodynamic field control for precise pattern formation

* **Simulated laser-based manufacturing processes** including thermal propagation in multi-material systems, implementing Beer-Lambert absorption models and Joule heating optimization to predict temperature distributions and optimize processing parameters for laser sintering and melting applications

* **Analyzed multi-physics manufacturing phenomena** combining electromagnetic field interactions, fluid dynamics (Reynolds number-dependent drag), and thermal transport to enable predictive modeling and parameter optimization for digital twin applications in advanced manufacturing
