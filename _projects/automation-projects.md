Developed autonomous robotics systems implementing Model Predictive Control and computer vision for dynamic stabilization and navigation.

## My Contributions

### Balancing Bot with Model Predictive Control

* **Designed and implemented a self-balancing robot** using Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms for real-time dynamic stabilization, demonstrating advanced control theory application

* **Integrated sensor fusion and state estimation** to provide accurate feedback for the MPC controller, achieving stable balancing performance under varying conditions

* **Executed complete hardware-software integration** from sensor selection through control algorithm deployment, creating a functional embedded robotics system

### Autonomous Navigation Bot with SLAM

* **Developed an autonomous navigation system** featuring simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for real-time environment mapping and self-localization

* **Implemented CNN-based visual sign recognition** using convolutional neural networks to enable the robot to detect and interpret visual cues in its environment

* **Integrated path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms** enabling autonomous decision-making and safe navigation through dynamic environments
