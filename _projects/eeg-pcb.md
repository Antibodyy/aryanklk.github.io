Designed and fabricated a custom PCB for acquiring micro-volt level EEG signals with high noise immunity.

## My Contributions

* **Designed complete PCB schematic and layout in KiCAD** using DFM-optimized design principles, ensuring manufacturability and reliable assembly for high-sensitivity analog circuits

* **Implemented multi-stage analog signal chain** with filtering and amplification to isolate micro-volt level EEG signals from ambient noise, achieving the sensitivity required for biomedical signal acquisition

* **Fabricated and debugged the prototype board** by soldering 20+ SMD components and performing comprehensive bring-up testing, successfully validating the design for high-sensitivity signal acquisition in noisy environments

## About This Project

This project involved developing a complete printed circuit board solution for acquiring EEG (electroencephalography) signals. The challenge required careful attention to noise isolation and signal integrity at the micro-volt level, demanding precise analog circuit design and PCB layout techniques.

## Technologies & Skills

* **PCB Design**: KiCAD (schematic capture, layout, DFM optimization)
* **Circuit Design**: Analog filtering, multi-stage amplification, noise characterization
* **Prototyping**: SMD soldering, board bring-up, signal chain debugging
* **Analysis**: Signal integrity analysis, noise isolation techniques

**Timeline**: August 2025 - December 2025
