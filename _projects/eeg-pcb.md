Designed and debugged a custom PCB in KiCAD for high-sensitivity analog signal acquisition.

## Project Overview

Developed a complete printed circuit board solution for acquiring EEG (electroencephalography) signals, requiring careful attention to noise isolation and signal integrity at the micro-volt level.

## Key Contributions

* **Custom PCB Design**: Designed full schematic and layout in KiCAD with DFM-optimized design principles
* **Analog Signal Chain**: Implemented multi-stage filtering and amplification to isolate micro-volt signals from ambient noise
* **Hands-On Prototyping**: Soldered 20+ SMD components and performed comprehensive board bring-up and debugging
* **Signal Integrity**: Achieved functional requirements for high-sensitivity analog signal acquisition in noisy environments

## Technologies Used

* PCB Design: KiCAD
* Circuit Design: Analog filtering, amplification stages
* Manufacturing: SMD soldering, DFM optimization
* Testing: Signal chain debugging, noise characterization
