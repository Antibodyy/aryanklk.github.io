## My Contributions

* **Designed and implemented a high-precision metrology system** with established tolerance budgeting to ensure sub-micron measurement accuracy across the large-format build area, enabling quality control for the manufacturing process

* **Executed structural and opto-mechanical design improvements** to enhance system rigidity, thermal stability, and optical alignment precision for the large-format lithography components, directly improving print quality and repeatability

* **Developed a custom 4-axis G-Code pipeline** to synchronize hardware motion control with optical projections, enabling precise layer-by-layer fabrication and expanding the system's manufacturing capabilities

## About HeliCAL


HeliCAL is a cutting-edge additive manufacturing system that uses lithography-based projection techniques to enable large-format, high-precision 3D printing. The system combines optical projection with synchronized motion control to build parts with sub-micron accuracy at scales beyond conventional lithography systems.
