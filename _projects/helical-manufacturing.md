Developing metrology systems, mechanical improvements, and motion control software for a large-format lithography-based 3D printing system.

## My Contributions

* **Designed and implemented a high-precision metrology system** with established tolerance budgeting to ensure sub-micron measurement accuracy across the large-format build area, enabling quality control for the manufacturing process

* **Executed structural and opto-mechanical design improvements** to enhance system rigidity, thermal stability, and optical alignment precision for the large-format lithography components, directly improving print quality and repeatability

* **Developed a custom 4-axis G-Code pipeline** to synchronize hardware motion control with optical projections, enabling precise layer-by-layer fabrication and expanding the system's manufacturing capabilities

## About HeliCAL

HeliCAL is a cutting-edge additive manufacturing system that uses lithography-based projection techniques to enable large-format, high-precision 3D printing. The system combines optical projection with synchronized motion control to build parts with sub-micron accuracy at scales beyond conventional lithography systems.

## Technologies & Skills

* **CAD & Design**: SolidWorks, Fusion 360
* **Motion Control**: Custom G-Code pipeline development, 4-axis synchronization
* **Analysis**: Tolerance budgeting, precision metrology, structural analysis
* **Manufacturing**: High-precision fabrication and assembly

**Timeline**: August 2025 - Present
