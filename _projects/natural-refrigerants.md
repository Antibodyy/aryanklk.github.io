Achieved 15% COP improvement over synthetic R-404a refrigerant through optimized R290-R744 cascade system design.

## My Contributions

* **Conducted analytical study of naturally-occurring refrigerants** comparing environmental impact against high-GWP (Global Warming Potential) and ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) synthetic alternatives, supporting the transition to sustainable refrigeration

* **Simulated and optimized various refrigeration cycles** using the REFPROP thermodynamic properties database in MATLAB, enabling data-driven comparison of refrigerant performance across operating conditions

* **Designed an R290-R744 cascade refrigeration system** for deep freezing applications, achieving 15% COP (Coefficient of Performance) improvement over conventional R-404a systems while eliminating high-GWP synthetic refrigerants

## About This Project

This project addressed the environmental impact of synthetic refrigerants in deep freezing applications. By evaluating naturally-occurring refrigerants (R290 - propane and R744 - carbon dioxide) as alternatives to high-GWP synthetic options, the work demonstrated both environmental and performance benefits through cascade system design optimization.

## Technologies & Skills

* **Simulation & Modeling**: MATLAB, REFPROP thermodynamic database
* **Thermodynamics**: Refrigeration cycle analysis, cascade system design
* **Analysis**: COP optimization, GWP/ODP environmental impact assessment
* **Design**: Deep freezing system architecture, refrigerant selection

**Timeline**: January 2023 - June 2023
